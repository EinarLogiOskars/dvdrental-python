# DVD rental app

### This is a docker app containing two services;

<ul>
    <li>
        db - A service containing a PostgreSQL database.
    </li>
    <li>
        backend - A service running an Python Flask API.
    </li>
</ul>

### I started this project with a few things in mind;

<ul>
    <li>
        Show skills - First and foremost I needed to create something to showcase programming capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Docker - I was interested in containerized applications and wanted to learn to use docker.
    </li>
    <li>
        Python - I studied in Java so I wanted to try my hands at a different language and so decided to learn python.
    </li>
    <li>
        SQL - I needed to brush up on SQL. 
    </li>
</ul>
